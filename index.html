 <h3> Description: </h3>

 <article> 

 
 A tale in which all of humanity is suddenly transported to a vast, unfamiliar world known as Isel—a barren land devoid of grass, resources, or life, defined only by endless mountains and unyielding dirt.

 <br>

 In this desolate new realm, a mysterious phenomenon begins to occur, striking individuals at random and pulling them into an even greater and more enigmatic world known as Astonia.

 <br>

 There, the chosen must fight to survive, forced to clear the perilous zones they are cast into. Only by doing so can they return to Isel—bringing with them precious resources from Astonia, vital for the survival and rebirth of humanity in the harsh lands of their new home.
